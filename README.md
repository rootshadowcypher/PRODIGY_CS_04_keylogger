## Introduction

Keyloggers are tools used to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer. This simple keylogger demonstrates how keystroke logging works. The captured data is stored in a log file, which can be analyzed later. It is important to understand the ethical implications and legal requirements before using this tool.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes made on the keyboard.
- Saves logged keystrokes to a text file.
- Runs in the background without interrupting user activities.

## Installation

To set up and run the Simple Keylogger:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rootshadowcypher/simple-keylogger.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd simple-keylogger
    ```

## Usage

To use the Simple Keylogger:

1. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```

2. The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and save them to `keylog.txt` by default.

3. To stop the keylogger, close the script or use a predefined key combination if implemented.

## Ethical Considerations

Keylogging can be a powerful tool for both good and malicious purposes. It is essential to use this tool responsibly and ethically:

- **Obtain explicit permission** from the owner of the device before running the keylogger.
- **Inform users** if their keystrokes are being recorded.
- **Do not use** this tool to invade privacy or for any illegal activities.
